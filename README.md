# CVRCCK-Docs
Crowd-sourced documentation for CVR's CCK.

Contributions are more than welcome. The official documentation doesn't contain extensive details or tutorials so feel free to add any information to here that you think is worth noting. The 3.3 folder contains the docs for v3.3 and will be fact checked when the CVR servers are more stable so we can test avatars.

# CVR
Official documentation is available at https://documentation.abinteractive.net/cck/.

This repo intends to provide more detailed tutorials to help new users understand the CCK.

No need to update your Unity version.  All of the above tools work with Unity 2019.4.31f1 and the latest version of the CCK.

Always remember to make backups of your avatars/projects before conversion and tag your content appropriately on upload.
