# HowTo

Avatar controls can be generated by checking the `Enabled Advanced Settings` box in the `CVR Avatar` script

If you have no animator already generated (though a lot will due to conversion), then select the default CVR animator for the `base animator`. It's called `AvatarAnimator`

You can then start adding in avatar controls... So let's toggle something

When you press the plus button you'll be able to choose a parameter name. Let's call it `ToggleExample`

The `Type` should be `Game Object Toggle`

The `Generate Type` should be `Generate Bool`

We'll leave `Default` off and `Use Animation` false since we don't have an animation already

Add a game object into the list

At the bottom, press `CreateAnimator`. This will generate an animator which will then be automatically applied

You can find out the name by looking in the `Animation Overrides` at the top of the `CVR Avatar` script

Putting that animator controller into your avatar's animator compontent's controller will let you see the generated animator
